abstract = {Communication between cells requires key and specialized signaling systems, like G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Cells coexpress a large number of different GPCRs, the activation of which generates multiple signals that are integrated via mechanisms still not well understood. The Class C GPCRs like the metabotropic receptors for glutamate (mGlu), GABA (GABAB), or calcium ions (CaSR), have been shown to functionally crosstalk with other receptor systems, leading to synergistic or new signaling responses involved in important physiological functions. The Class C GPCRs are well-known dimeric receptors, either homodimeric (mGlu or CaSR) or heterodimeric (GABAB or taste T1R1/T1R3 and T1R2/T1R3) receptors. Moreover, they have been reported to form oligomeric complexes themselves or associated to other receptors. As the receptor oligomerization often affect binding, activity, or signaling of GPCRs, the formation of receptor heteromers has been used as an explanation for many of the described crosstalk involving these receptors. Here, we will discuss that crosstalk could result not only from receptor oligomerization, but also from colocalized receptor sharing signaling pathways, or from synergistic regulation of signaling crossroads, independently of oligomerization.}

abstract={Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most prescribed antidepressants. They regulate serotonergic neurotransmission, but it remains unclear how altered serotonergic neurotransmission may contribute to the SSRI resistance observed in approximately 30{\%} of major depressive disorder (MDD) patients. Patient stratification based on pharmacological responsiveness and the use of patient-derived neurons may make possible the discovery of disease-relevant neural phenotypes. In our study from a large cohort of well-characterized MDD patients, we have generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from SSRI-remitters and SSRI-nonremitters. We studied serotonergic neurotransmission in patient forebrain neurons in vitro and observed that nonremitter patient-derived neurons displayed serotonin-induced hyperactivity downstream of upregulated excitatory serotonergic receptors, in contrast to what is seen in healthy and remitter patient-derived neurons. Our data suggest that postsynaptic forebrain hyperactivity downstream of SSRI treatment may play a role in SSRI resistance in MDD.},

    abstract = "{Functional enrichment analysis is a key step in interpreting gene lists discovered in diverse high-throughput experiments. g:Profiler studies flat and ranked gene lists and finds statistically significant Gene Ontology terms, pathways and other gene function related terms. Translation of hundreds of gene identifiers is another core feature of g:Profiler. Since its first publication in 2007, our web server has become a popular tool of choice among basic and translational researchers. Timeliness is a major advantage of g:Profiler as genome and pathway information is synchronized with the Ensembl database in quarterly updates. g:Profiler supports 213 species including mammals and other vertebrates, plants, insects and fungi. The 2016 update of g:Profiler introduces several novel features. We have added further functional datasets to interpret gene lists, including transcription factor binding site predictions, Mendelian disease annotations, information about protein expression and complexes and gene mappings of human genetic polymorphisms. Besides the interactive web interface, g:Profiler can be accessed in computational pipelines using our R package, Python interface and BioJS component. g:Profiler is freely available at http://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/.}",
